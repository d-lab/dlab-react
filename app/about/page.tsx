            Our purpose is to conduct research aimed at identifying the risks and harms of AI and building AI for public good.
            <br />
            We conduct research at the intersection of Data, People, and AI. This involves research contributions to the fields of Computational Social Science, Human-Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, Information Retrieval.
            <br />
            Our current PhD students work on the following research topics: LLMs for relevance judgments, political bias in LLMs, controlling bias in LLMs, data-centric ML fairness, LLMs for persuasion, Legal NLP, the impact of LLMs on human-decision making, and human-AI teaming.
            <br />
            We thank our current sponsors that support our research: the Australian Research Council and the Swiss National Science Foundation. Our past sponsors include: the Wikimedia Foundation, Google, Meta, the EU Horizon 2020 Programme Framework, and the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.
            <br />
            The DLab is led by Prof. Gianluca Demartini at The University of Queensland, Australia.
